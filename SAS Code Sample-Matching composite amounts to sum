/*Background
There is a list of accounts with negative balances. However, the transactions that comprise those balances are not known. Therefore, we must
match the list of negative balances with their corresponding transactions from another dataset. For this project, I create a program to match
the composite transactions that make up the total negative balance for a given account. Some additional details:

-There are two datasets: 
    1. An account-level dataset (acct_bal) with the outstanding balance for that account, and
    2. A transaction-level dataset (acct_trx) containing the specifics of transactions for all accounts
-The acct_trx dataset contains other accounts than just the ones in acct_bal.
-There are more transactions for each account than those that make up the outstanding balance.
    E.g. An account has an outstanding balance of $1000 on acct_bal, but has 7 transactions totaling $1450 on acct_trx.
-The composite transactions may not necessarily equal the outstanding balance; some transactions maybe be missing from acct_trx, an error may have been 
made when calculating the outstanding balance (the data may have been manually entered), etc.
-Outstanding balances could be the result of events made of debits or credits, i.e. both directions must be considered, although a balance
comprised of both is unlikely
-Every balance has a corresponding event date, i.e. the date the outstanding balance was realized. However, the composite transactions do not
necessarily (and often do not) occur on the same date.


The following code joins the datasets together, then finds all possible combinations of transactions for each account and produces the combination that is
most likely to be the true set if composite transactions based on ranking criteria
